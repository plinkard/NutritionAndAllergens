# NutritionAndAllergens
HackGT2022 Website Concept for Tracking Restaurant Nutrition and Allergen Information

This project is a co-collaboration project with @Wimage03, @Arringtonn, @Lin-Jenny, made at the HackGT 2022 Retro Reset 36-hour Hack-A-Thon as an emerging participant group.

##About this Project
Have you ever gone to a resturant and struggled to find food you can eat because the allergen information is not listed?

This project seeks to make nutrition and allergen information more readily accessible to everyday patrons, and make it easier for buisnesses big and small to post this information without giving away secret recipies.

##How It Works
This is a mock-up of a fake resturant offering a varitey of food options.
